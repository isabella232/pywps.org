# Welcome to PyWPS

PyWPS (Python Web Processing Service) is an implementation of the Web processing Service standard from Open Geospatial Consortium. PyWPS is written in Python.

The project was initially started by [Jachym Cepicky](http://les-ejk.cz) as part of his project 'Connecting of GRASS GIS with UMN MapServer' supported by the [German Foundation for Environment](http://dbu.de/).  He began to work on this project from April 2006 to September 2006, while on scholarship by [GDF-Hannover](http://gdf-hannover.de/).

PyWPS enables integration, publishing and execution of Python processes via the WPS standard.

PyWPS is Open Source and released under an MIT [license](license).
